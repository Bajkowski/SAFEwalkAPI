# SAFEwalk Mobile App

A mobile app for the University of Wisconsin's SAFEwalk service on campus.

## Background
The safety of our students and our faculty is paramount. With Safewalk, a free walking companionship service, students and staff can safely get from one place to another. However, currently to schedule a Safewalk, users must call or text a phone number to speak with a dispatcher. The dispatcher has to first determine eligibility for a Safewalk by getting information manually, including one’s name, phone number, and location before dispatching a team over. This cumbersome exchange of information can often take over a minute. That long minute is especially concerning when considering that someone requiring a Safewalk may be in immediate need of it. Furthermore, the time and personnel to receive the calls are also costly. The current solution is just not scalable and efficient enough when time is a factor of safety.

This application will automate the scheduling process. Users will be able to schedule Safewalks with very little latency as the middle men, the dispatcher, is removed from the process, and most eligibility and security checks will be done upon initial account creation. This will cut down scheduling time to under ten seconds. With the use of live geolocation tracking of the other party and messaging, there will also be better transparency and communication between users and Safewalkers.
